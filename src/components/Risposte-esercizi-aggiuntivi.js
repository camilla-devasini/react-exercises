//COMPONENTS-08
//Can you use the Hello component more than once in the App component?
//What happens if you do?
//- Yes i can. I will duplicate the component that will be rendered more times in the browser.

//COMPONENTS-09
//Can you render the Message component directly within the App component? What happens if you do?
// - Yes i can but it will become a single component by itself, independent (not part of title component anymore)


//STATE-02
// When calling setState to increment the counter, should the parameter be a function or an object?
//Why?  We need to pass a callback function carrying the current state, because we need to work with
// the last version of the state.
